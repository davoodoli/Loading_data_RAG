# Data Loading for Retrieval in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
 This repository contains code for loading data as the first step of Retrieval in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The code utilizes various loaders from LangChain to handle different types of data sources, including PDFs, text files, web pages, and Wikipedia articles.
## Introduction
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that combines the power of retrieval and generation to provide accurate and contextually relevant responses. The first step in RAG involves loading the data that will be used for retrieval. This repository demonstrates how to load data from various sources using loaders from LangChain.

## Loading PDF Data
Use PyPDFLoader to load data from PDF files. This allows you to extract content from PDF documents and make it available for retrieval processes.

## Loading Text Data
Use TextLoader to load data from text files. This is useful for processing plain text documents and incorporating them into your retrieval system.

## Loading Web Page Data
Use WebBaseLoader to load data from web pages. This enables you to scrape content from websites and include it in your retrieval framework.

## Loading Wikipedia Data
Use WikipediaLoader to load data from Wikipedia articles. This helps you fetch and utilize information from Wikipedia for your retrieval tasks.
